A simple TypeScript Project that uses Geocoding Google Maps API to provide a maping service.
The goal of the project is to understand TypeScript and Wepback better and get a grasp on how google maps API's work and how to implement them properly with TypeScript.

To make it all work I have used Google Maps API and Webpack to deploy a page with a search bar and a div holding the google map.
You as a user can search for various places and locations all around to world and have it displayed on the page.
The whole project was done in plain JavaScript and TypeScript.
Webpack was used to configuration, deployment and running the development tool.
